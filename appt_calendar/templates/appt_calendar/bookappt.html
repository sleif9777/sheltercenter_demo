    <p class="standalone">You can use this space to provide any preferences ahead of your appointment. This can include desired size, gender, or age. You can also provide the names of dogs you wish to see during your appointment that you have noticed on our website or social media. If you have no particular specifics and are open to meeting all dogs, you can note this as well.</p>
    <p>Please note that providing the names of specific dogs does not guarantee you the opportunity to meet/adopt them. All dogs are available on a first-come-first-serve basis and can potentially be adopted prior to your appointment. Some may not fit well with the home environment you are able to provide. We are happy to introduce you to a number of compatible matches during your appointment. The Adoptions team emphasizes that keeping an open mind and not narrowing your scope to only one or two dogs from the website is the best way to experience our program.</p>

I will come into my appointment prepared to take a dog home immediately following, even if this is not the actual outcome. </label>
